# WowWizard - A form wizard for your taste!
WowWizard is a jQuery plugin that is designed for developers seeking an awesome & multi-purpose form wizard.
## Install
You can install by simply cloning the package & including the dev/css & dev/js files; or you can install with npm/bower:
```
$ npm install wowwizard
$ bower install wowwizard
```
## Getting Started
Gettings started guide and complete documentation can be found [here](http://yigitozkavci.github.io/wowwizard/).

You can also check out examples directory to get a sneak peek what it looks like.
## Contributing
For now, plugin needs theme & front-end improvements. But pull requests for both front-end and back-end are welcomed!
You need both npm and gulp to edit the /dev/css/.sass and /dev/js/.js files and compile them to /dist/css/.css and /dev/js/.min.js files.

There is already a .gulpfile inside and you can compile those by simply typing
```
$ gulp watch
```
after you installed both npm and this package's devDependencies(which include gulp & its packages).
